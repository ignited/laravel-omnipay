Integrates the [Omnipay](https://github.com/adrianmacneil/omnipay) PHP library with Laravel 5 via a ServiceProvider to make Configuring multiple payment tunnels a breeze!

### Laravel 4 Support

For Laravel 4 see the [version 1.x](https://github.com/ignited/laravel-omnipay/tree/1.1.0) tree

### Now using Omnipay 2.3/2.5
 
Version `2.0` and onwards has been updated to use Omnipay 2.3.

Version `2.2` and onwards is using Omnipay 2.5

### Composer Configuration

Include the laravel-omnipay package as a dependency in your `composer.json`:

    "ignited/laravel-omnipay": "2.*"
    
**Note:** You don't need to include the `omnipay/common` in your composer.json - it is a requirement of the `laravel-omnipay` package.

Omnipay recently went refactoring that made it so that each package is now a seperate repository. The `omnipay/common` package includes the core framework. You will then need to include each gateway as you require. For example:

    "omnipay/eway": "*"
    
Alternatively you can include every gateway by requring:

    "omnipay/omnipay": "*"

**Note:** this requires a large amount of composer work as it needs to fetch each seperate repository. This is not recommended.

### Installation

Run `composer install` to download the dependencies.

#### Laravel 5

Add a ServiceProvider to your providers array in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [

	'Ignited\LaravelOmnipay\LaravelOmnipayServiceProvider',

]
```

Add the `Omnipay` facade to your facades array:

```php
	'Omnipay' => 'Ignited\LaravelOmnipay\Facades\OmnipayFacade',
```

Finally, publish the configuration files via `php artisan vendor:publish`.

#### Lumen

For `Lumen` add the following in your bootstrap/app.php
```php
$app->register(Ignited\LaravelOmnipay\LumenOmnipayServiceProvider::class);
```

Copy the laravel-omnipay.php file from the config directory to config/laravel-omnipay.php

And also add the following to bootstrap/app.php
```php
$app->configure('laravel-omnipay');
```

### Configuration

Once you have published the configuration files, you can add your gateway options to the config file in `config/laravel-omnipay.php`.

### Usage

```php
$cardInput = [
	'number'      => '4444333322221111',
	'firstName'   => 'MR. WALTER WHITE',
	'expiryMonth' => '03',
	'expiryYear'  => '16',
	'cvv'         => '333',
];

$card = Omnipay::creditCard($cardInput);
$response = Omnipay::purchase([
	'amount'    => '100.00',
	'returnUrl' => 'http://bobjones.com/payment/return',
	'cancelUrl' => 'http://bobjones.com/payment/cancel',
	'card'      => $cardInput
])->send();

dd($response->getMessage());
```
    
This will use the gateway specified in the config as `default`.

However, you can also specify a gateway to use.

```php
Omnipay::setGateway('eway');

$response = Omnipay::purchase([
	'amount' => '100.00',
	'card'   => $cardInput
])->send();

dd($response->getMessage());
```
    
In addition you can take an instance of the gateway.

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::gateway('eway');
```
